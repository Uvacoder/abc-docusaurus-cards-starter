# Kernel Development

Kernel Dev is essentially all the low level software that may or may not be a part of an Operating System. If you are interested in Operating Systems, it is highly recommended to join the OSDev [discord](https://discord.gg/osdev). They showcase various projects regularly.

All things OSDev and how the different parts of the master program assemble together come here. Although debatable, resources related to Compilers and Interpreters shall also be listed.
