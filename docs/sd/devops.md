# DevOps

[DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) is something of a newer part of the developement flow. It celebrates the idea of Continuous Integration and Continuous Development by providing a link between developers and versions, or operations.
This includes [Cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/) and Automation Technologies.

A [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) probably best describes how a good DevOps practitioner is diversified.
